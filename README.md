# motion_magnification
An unofficial implementation for https://people.csail.mit.edu/tiam/deepmag/ .
The offical code is https://github.com/12dmodel/deep_motion_mag , it is very professional and promising approach, it is recommended to read the original paper from the website, it is very helpful and benefical. The aurthors used Tensorflow 1.3 and 1.8, CUDA 8.5.
I have almost used the same code with the same configuration, i just changed a little in magnet.py , since i used "ffmpeg" converter instead of converter "avconv"
